# basic-file-exploit

## Information

### Description

The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!
Connect to the program with netcat:
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 55825
The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded here.

### Hints 

1. Try passing in things the program doesn't expect. Like a string instead of a number.

## Solution

### Code Review

1. Discovery
    * 檔案類型: ELF, 32bits
2. Research
    * 經過觀察可以看到 data_read() 的其中一段 code
        ```c
            if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) ==  0) {
                puts(flag);
                fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
                exit(0);
            }
        ```
3. Exploitation
    * 可以發現達成條件會 puts(flag)，假設這是我們所期望的結果，試想要如何達成條件。
