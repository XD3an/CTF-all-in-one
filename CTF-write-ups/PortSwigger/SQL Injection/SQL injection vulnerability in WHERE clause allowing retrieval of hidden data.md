# SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

## Information
---

- [PortSwigger - Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/lab-retrieve-hidden-data)

This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out an SQL query like the following:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that causes the application to display details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased. 

## Solution

1. 使用 **Burp Suite** 攔截 Request。

2. 更改 Request 中 `category`。
    ```
    ...category='+OR+1=1--...
    ...
    ```
